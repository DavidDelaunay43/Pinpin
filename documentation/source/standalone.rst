Standalone
==========

Browser
-------

You can browse the project assets:

.. image::
    ../images/standalone_browser_features.gif

By right-clicking on a file, you can:
* Reveal the location of the file in File Explorer
* Increment the file
* Write a comment

.. caution::
    If a file has not been opened for a long time, it is preferable to increment it from the standalone application rather than opening the latest version.
